## Features
* Who Needs SQL is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Who Needs SQL uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, 4rm also uses a JavaScript date library format timestamps.

## Known Bugs
Still working on this assignment. Lots of functionality still needed.
